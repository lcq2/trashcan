Research projects I'm working on, but not really mature enough

A collection of research projects I'm working on, some of them will be promoted to a proper repo, some of them will most likely die.

## Current status
riscv-emu - simple RISC-V emulator written in C++, still work in progress
xarfcn_scan - SDR research project, scans for GMSK "looking" modulation over a 200 kHz bandwidth, using a simple power ratio approach, nothing particuarly complex or fool-proof, however it can detect available channels in my city (but of course they coudld be whatever GMSK-looking modulation); tested with Ettus B210
